This code allows you to create and replicate the path to be followed by a "writer" printer, furthermore the folder also has a Blender model to be able to print it in 3D.

ðŸ‘¾TO RUN:
Visual Studio 2022.1 was used for the development, you can start the program by loading the code and starting it.
You can reproduce it directly from the IDE or using programs that support the graphical interface of .py files.
You can open the 3D model using Blender or some other program that supports the extension.
I recommend keeping the same versions of the IDE indicated, in order not to encounter errors.
